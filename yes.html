            <p>We probably had the worst fight ever this time, nai?. I have never seen you this angry.Good thing we took the break, we needed it even though my heart was denying it. Ik u still think this fight was completely my fault I dont know in this break if you thought about ke what might have triggered this even or anything else. But even after thinking if you still think it was my fault I will accept it. This fight is not worth getting seperated from the bestest friend I ever made </p>
